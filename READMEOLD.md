## **About the Submission**

### **Overview** 
We all have that one relative (maybe a parent or grandparent) who calls when something isn’t working on their phone, laptop, or TV. Tech Buddy is our attempt to make that experience easier for everyone.

It’s a simple, AI-powered web app where family members—especially elderly ones—can type out their tech problems in everyday language. Whether it’s “Can you fix my phone? It’s not charging.” “How do I transfer money on this app?” or “How do I reset my password?” Tech Buddy gives them instant, easy-to-follow help.

We designed this to feel personal, clear, and approachable. It’s like having a patient tech-savvy friend available 24/7, without needing to make a call or wait for someone to stop by. And for peace of mind, family members can still get updates or stay connected.

### **Goal**
**Tech Buddy** was created with real people in mind — especially those who didn’t grow up with technology but still need to use it every day. Here’s what we hope to achieve with this project:

*   **Give confidence to non-technical users:** We want users to feel empowered, not intimidated, when facing a tech issue. With clear, simple explanations, they can troubleshoot problems on their own without feeling overwhelmed or helpless.

*   **Lighten the load on tech-savvy family members:**
Tech support from loved ones is usually just a call away but it can be stressful for both sides. Tech Buddy offers a gentle, always-available alternative that helps reduce pressure while keeping the support system in place.

*   **Make tech help feel friendly, personal, and easy to understand:** No tech jargon. No complicated steps. Just straightforward, human-centered assistance. We want users to feel like they’re chatting with a patient, knowledgeable friend not reading from a manual.

*   **Integrate AI gently, so it supports users without overwhelming them:** Tech Buddy uses AI to generate custom responses that are clear, helpful, and respectful of the user's experience level. The goal isn’t just to “answer a question,” but to offer guidance that feels human.
